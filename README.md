# Computer Vision: Vehicle Counter
**Vehicle Counter Program utilizing YOLO and Python** is designed to detect and count vehicles passing through a designated area in real-time. This program utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection and the Python programming language as its development foundation. It serves as a project for the Image Processing course.

## Key Features
1. **Vehicle Detection:** Utilizes the YOLO model to detect various types of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks.
2. **Vehicle Counting:** Counts the number of vehicles passing through the specified area.
3. **Real-Time Processing:** The program can process video directly from a camera or pre-recorded video file.
4. **Simple User Interface:** Displays detection results and vehicle counts in annotated video format.

## Technologies Used
1. **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Fast and accurate object detection algorithm.
2. **Python:** The primary programming language used for program development.
3. **OpenCV:** Library for image and video processing

## Development Steps
1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Easy installation of Python and necessary libraries with `pip install -r requirement.txt`

2. **Video Data Acquisition:**
   - Preparation of video source from camera or video file.
   - Setting input video parameters within the code.

3. **Implementation of Detection and Counting:**
   - Integration of the YOLO model into the Python program.
   - Processing each video frame to detect and identify vehicles.
   - Counting the number of detected vehicles and displaying real-time results.

4. **Testing and Evaluation:**
   - Testing the program under various lighting conditions and traffic densities.
   - Evaluating the accuracy of vehicle detection and counting.

5. **Program Refinement:**
   - Code optimization to improve speed and efficiency.
   - Adding additional features such as vehicle type classification or statistical reporting.

## User Benefits
